# 📊 Expense Tracker App (MERN Stack)

A **full-stack Expense Tracker web application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.  
The application allows users to securely manage income and expenses, visualize financial data using interactive charts, and export reports in Excel format.

> ⚠️ This project was built by following a structured YouTube tutorial to understand real-world MERN architecture, authentication, API design, and frontend–backend integration.
